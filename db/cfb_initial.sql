What does this mean? <strong>Functional Movements</strong> are those movements that you perform every day. They are the natural, effective, and efficient movements that are used to move your body as well as other objects. They allow us to move large loads over long distances and to do so quickly. <strong>Intensity</strong> is synonymous with power which is a measurement of how much, how many, how far, and how fast we perform these functional movements. Intensity is relative to each individual and the idea is to maximize each individual&rsquo;s level of intensity. <strong>Constantly Varied</strong> means to take these functional movements and perform them in as many different combinations and variations as possible.</p>\r\n<p>CrossFit, in practice, is a Strength and Conditioning Program that is &ldquo;broad, general, and inclusive&rdquo;, developing the functional fitness necessary to be ready for the unknown. It aims to prepare you for whatever task life has in store for you and in the same sense can be used by each individual to further their specific goals. CrossFit combines Power Lifting, Olympic Weightlifting, Gymnastics, Kettlebell Training, Running, Rowing, Jumping Rope, Mobility, and more to develop and maximize these <strong>10 General Physical Skills</strong>:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Cardiovascular/Respiratory Endurance</li>\r\n<li>Stamina</li>\r\n<li>Strength</li>\r\n<li>Flexibility</li>\r\n<li>Power</li>\r\n<li>Speed</li>\r\n<li>Coordination</li>\r\n<li>Agility</li>\r\n<li>Balance</li>\r\n<li>Accuracy</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>CrossFit is for people from all walks of life; from professional athletes to senior citizens to people with disabilities. Every workout can be scaled to fit the fitness level of the individual so that everyone is performing at the threshold of their own personal limitations. CrossFit is more than a fitness program. CrossFit is an international community of people that challenge themselves and encourage others to challenge themselves to be better athletes and better people. CrossFit develops the physical and mental toughness and confidence to take on any and all of life&rsquo;s challenges.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;World-Class Fitness in 100 Words:<br /> Eat meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch and no sugar. Keep intake to levels that will support exercise but not body fat. Practice and train major lifts: Deadlift, clean, squat, presses, C&amp;J, and snatch. Similarly, master the basics of gymnastics: pull-ups, dips, rope climb, push-ups, sit-ups, presses to handstand, pirouettes, flips, splits, and holds. Bike, run, swim, row, etc, hard and fast. Five or six days per week mix these elements in as many combinations and patterns as creativity will allow. Routine is the enemy. Keep workouts short and intense. Regularly learn and play new sports.&rdquo;<br /><br /> <span style=\"float: right;\">~ Greg Glassman (Owner and Founder of CrossFit)</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1>&nbsp;</h1>\r\n<h1>&nbsp;</h1>\r\n<h1>&nbsp;</h1>\r\n<h1 id=\"coaches\">Coaches</h1>\r\n<p><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"../../../../../system/cms/files/files/000/000/003/original/dom.png\" alt=\"Dom\" width=\"325\" height=\"312\" /></p>\r\n<div>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<h3>Dominic Morisi</h3>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Age: 27</li>\r\n<li>Experience:</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>5 Years of CrossFit</li>\r\n<li>5 Years of Coaching</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>Certifications:</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>NFPT (2009)</li>\r\n<li>CrossFit Level1(2011)</li>\r\n<li>USAW Level1 (2012)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>My name is Dominic Morisi, and I was born and raised in Baltimore.

Your first class is on us! Whether you are brand new to CrossFit or an experienced CrossFitter, your first class is FREE. If you are new to CrossFit or consider yourself a beginner you must drop in on one of our Fundamentals Classes so that we can get you started on our Fundamentals Program. If you can&rsquo;t make it to our Fundamentals Class or you want to get started right away, call to schedule a 1-on-1 session with one of our coaches. Only experienced CrossFitters may drop in on any class or open gym. Please show up at least 15 minutes prior to the start of your first class so that you have time to get acquainted with our facility and our staff as well as sign the waiver.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1 id=\"fundamentals\">Fundamentals</h1>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are new to CrossFit you must attend at least 4 Fundamentals classes. The Fundamentals classes are designed to introduce new members to the core movements of CrossFit. The Fundamentals classes will give beginners the opportunity to develop technique while progressively increasing intensity. We will be developing functional movements to provide a solid foundation for future Strength and Conditioning.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Movements to be covered during the Fundamentals Classes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Squatting: Air Squat, Back Squat, Front Squat, Overhead Squat</li>\r\n<li>Pressing: Shoulder Press, Push Press, Push Jerk, Split Jerk</li>\r\n<li>Pulling: Deadlift, Sumo Deadlift High Pull, Clean, Snatch, Kettlebell Swing</li>\r\n<li>Gymnastics: Push-up, Pull-up, Sit-ups, Back &amp; Hip Extensions, Box Jump</li>\r\n<li>Metabolic Conditioning: Rowing, Running, Jumping Rope</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These movements will be taught in an environment that focuses on safety through proper form. Come ready to work hard and have fun while learning something new! Each class is 1 hour long and it is offered on every Tuesday and Thursday evening 7:30-8:30 p.m. If you are unable to attend at these times, please call and schedule an appointment. &nbsp;The classes will begin with a warm up specific to the movements that will be learned that day. The majority of the hour will be spent working on developing the technique of the functional movements that will be covered during that class. Participants will then complete a WOD that will be scaled to each individual&rsquo;s fitness level. Following the WOD, there will be a cool down and a brief period of time to ask questions or discuss any of the movements learned that day or in any other Fundamentals class.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beginners must complete at least 4 Fundamentals Classes before joining group classes. You may choose to continue attending Fundamentals Classes if you think that it would benefit you or if you are not comfortable joining the group classes after your 4th class. One-on-one individualized coaching is also available by appointment only.

What does this mean? <strong>Functional Movements</strong> are those movements that you perform every day. They are the natural, effective, and efficient movements that are used to move your body as well as other objects. They allow us to move large loads over long distances and to do so quickly. <strong>Intensity</strong> is synonymous with power which is a measurement of how much, how many, how far, and how fast we perform these functional movements. Intensity is relative to each individual and the idea is to maximize each individual&rsquo;s level of intensity. <strong>Constantly Varied</strong> means to take these functional movements and perform them in as many different combinations and variations as possible.</p>\r\n<p>CrossFit, in practice, is a Strength and Conditioning Program that is &ldquo;broad, general, and inclusive&rdquo;, developing the functional fitness necessary to be ready for the unknown. It aims to prepare you for whatever task life has in store for you and in the same sense can be used by each individual to further their specific goals. CrossFit combines Power Lifting, Olympic Weightlifting, Gymnastics, Kettlebell Training, Running, Rowing, Jumping Rope, Mobility, and more to develop and maximize these <strong>10 General Physical Skills</strong>:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Cardiovascular/Respiratory Endurance</li>\r\n<li>Stamina</li>\r\n<li>Strength</li>\r\n<li>Flexibility</li>\r\n<li>Power</li>\r\n<li>Speed</li>\r\n<li>Coordination</li>\r\n<li>Agility</li>\r\n<li>Balance</li>\r\n<li>Accuracy</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>CrossFit is for people from all walks of life; from professional athletes to senior citizens to people with disabilities. Every workout can be scaled to fit the fitness level of the individual so that everyone is performing at the threshold of their own personal limitations. CrossFit is more than a fitness program. CrossFit is an international community of people that challenge themselves and encourage others to challenge themselves to be better athletes and better people. CrossFit develops the physical and mental toughness and confidence to take on any and all of life&rsquo;s challenges.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;World-Class Fitness in 100 Words:<br /> Eat meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch and no sugar. Keep intake to levels that will support exercise but not body fat. Practice and train major lifts: Deadlift, clean, squat, presses, C&amp;J, and snatch. Similarly, master the basics of gymnastics: pull-ups, dips, rope climb, push-ups, sit-ups, presses to handstand, pirouettes, flips, splits, and holds. Bike, run, swim, row, etc, hard and fast. Five or six days per week mix these elements in as many combinations and patterns as creativity will allow. Routine is the enemy. Keep workouts short and intense. Regularly learn and play new sports.&rdquo;<br /><br /> <span style=\"float: right;\">~ Greg Glassman (Owner and Founder of CrossFit)</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1>&nbsp;</h1>\r\n<h1>&nbsp;</h1>\r\n<h1>&nbsp;</h1>\r\n<h1 id=\"coaches\">Coaches</h1>\r\n<p><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"../../../../../system/cms/files/files/000/000/003/original/dom.png\" alt=\"Dom\" width=\"325\" height=\"312\" /></p>\r\n<div>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<h3>Dominic Morisi</h3>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Age: 27</li>\r\n<li>Experience:</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>5 Years of CrossFit</li>\r\n<li>5 Years of Coaching</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>Certifications:</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>NFPT (2009)</li>\r\n<li>CrossFit Level1(2011)</li>\r\n<li>USAW Level1 (2012)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>My name is Dominic Morisi, and I was born and raised in Baltimore.

Your first class is on us! Whether you are brand new to CrossFit or an experienced CrossFitter, your first class is FREE. If you are new to CrossFit or consider yourself a beginner you must drop in on one of our Fundamentals Classes so that we can get you started on our Fundamentals Program. If you can&rsquo;t make it to our Fundamentals Class or you want to get started right away, call to schedule a 1-on-1 session with one of our coaches. Only experienced CrossFitters may drop in on any class or open gym. Please show up at least 15 minutes prior to the start of your first class so that you have time to get acquainted with our facility and our staff as well as sign the waiver.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1 id=\"fundamentals\">Fundamentals</h1>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are new to CrossFit you must attend at least 4 Fundamentals classes. The Fundamentals classes are designed to introduce new members to the core movements of CrossFit. The Fundamentals classes will give beginners the opportunity to develop technique while progressively increasing intensity. We will be developing functional movements to provide a solid foundation for future Strength and Conditioning.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Movements to be covered during the Fundamentals Classes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Squatting: Air Squat, Back Squat, Front Squat, Overhead Squat</li>\r\n<li>Pressing: Shoulder Press, Push Press, Push Jerk, Split Jerk</li>\r\n<li>Pulling: Deadlift, Sumo Deadlift High Pull, Clean, Snatch, Kettlebell Swing</li>\r\n<li>Gymnastics: Push-up, Pull-up, Sit-ups, Back &amp; Hip Extensions, Box Jump</li>\r\n<li>Metabolic Conditioning: Rowing, Running, Jumping Rope</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These movements will be taught in an environment that focuses on safety through proper form. Come ready to work hard and have fun while learning something new! Each class is 1 hour long and it is offered on every Tuesday and Thursday evening 7:30-8:30 p.m. If you are unable to attend at these times, please call and schedule an appointment. &nbsp;The classes will begin with a warm up specific to the movements that will be learned that day. The majority of the hour will be spent working on developing the technique of the functional movements that will be covered during that class. Participants will then complete a WOD that will be scaled to each individual&rsquo;s fitness level. Following the WOD, there will be a cool down and a brief period of time to ask questions or discuss any of the movements learned that day or in any other Fundamentals class.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beginners must complete at least 4 Fundamentals Classes before joining group classes.

What does this\n    mean? <strong>Functional Movements</strong> are those movements that you perform\n    every day. They are the natural, effective, and efficient movements that are used\n    to move your body as well as other objects. They allow us to move large loads\n    over long distances and to do so quickly. <strong>Intensity</strong> is synonymous\n    with power which is a measurement of how much, how many, how far, and how fast\n    we perform these functional movements.

What does this\n    mean? <strong>Functional Movements</strong> are those movements that you perform\n    every day. They are the natural, effective, and efficient movements that are used\n    to move your body as well as other objects. They allow us to move large loads\n    over long distances and to do so quickly. <strong>Intensity</strong> is synonymous\n    with power which is a measurement of how much, how many, how far, and how fast\n    we perform these functional movements. Intensity is relative to each individual\n    and the idea is to maximize each individual&rsquo;s level of intensity. <strong>Constantly\n    Varied</strong> means to take these functional movements and perform them in as\n    many different combinations and variations as possible.</p>\\r\\n<p>CrossFit, in\n    practice, is a Strength and Conditioning Program that is &ldquo;broad, general,\n    and inclusive&rdquo;, developing the functional fitness necessary to be ready\n    for the unknown. It aims to prepare you for whatever task life has in store for\n    you and in the same sense can be used by each individual to further their specific\n    goals. CrossFit combines Power Lifting, Olympic Weightlifting, Gymnastics, Kettlebell\n    Training, Running, Rowing, Jumping Rope, Mobility, and more to develop and maximize\n    these <strong>10 General Physical Skills</strong>:</p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li>Cardiovascular/Respiratory\n    Endurance</li>\\r\\n<li>Stamina</li>\\r\\n<li>Strength</li>\\r\\n<li>Flexibility</li>\\r\\n<li>Power</li>\\r\\n<li>Speed</li>\\r\\n<li>Coordination</li>\\r\\n<li>Agility</li>\\r\\n<li>Balance</li>\\r\\n<li>Accuracy</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p>CrossFit\n    is for people from all walks of life; from professional athletes to senior citizens\n    to people with disabilities. Every workout can be scaled to fit the fitness level\n    of the individual so that everyone is performing at the threshold of their own\n    personal limitations. CrossFit is more than a fitness program. CrossFit is an\n    international community of people that challenge themselves and encourage others\n    to challenge themselves to be better athletes and better people. CrossFit develops\n    the physical and mental toughness and confidence to take on any and all of life&rsquo;s\n    challenges.</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>&ldquo;World-Class Fitness in 100 Words:<br\n    /> Eat meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch and no sugar.\n    Keep intake to levels that will support exercise but not body fat.

What does this\n    mean? <strong>Functional Movements</strong> are those movements that you perform\n    every day. They are the natural, effective, and efficient movements that are used\n    to move your body as well as other objects. They allow us to move large loads\n    over long distances and to do so quickly. <strong>Intensity</strong> is synonymous\n    with power which is a measurement of how much, how many, how far, and how fast\n    we perform these functional movements. Intensity is relative to each individual\n    and the idea is to maximize each individual&rsquo;s level of intensity. <strong>Constantly\n    Varied</strong> means to take these functional movements and perform them in as\n    many different combinations and variations as possible.</p>\\r\\n<p>CrossFit, in\n    practice, is a Strength and Conditioning Program that is &ldquo;broad, general,\n    and inclusive&rdquo;, developing the functional fitness necessary to be ready\n    for the unknown. It aims to prepare you for whatever task life has in store for\n    you and in the same sense can be used by each individual to further their specific\n    goals. CrossFit combines Power Lifting, Olympic Weightlifting, Gymnastics, Kettlebell\n    Training, Running, Rowing, Jumping Rope, Mobility, and more to develop and maximize\n    these <strong>10 General Physical Skills</strong>:</p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li>Cardiovascular/Respiratory\n    Endurance</li>\\r\\n<li>Stamina</li>\\r\\n<li>Strength</li>\\r\\n<li>Flexibility</li>\\r\\n<li>Power</li>\\r\\n<li>Speed</li>\\r\\n<li>Coordination</li>\\r\\n<li>Agility</li>\\r\\n<li>Balance</li>\\r\\n<li>Accuracy</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p>CrossFit\n    is for people from all walks of life; from professional athletes to senior citizens\n    to people with disabilities. Every workout can be scaled to fit the fitness level\n    of the individual so that everyone is performing at the threshold of their own\n    personal limitations. CrossFit is more than a fitness program. CrossFit is an\n    international community of people that challenge themselves and encourage others\n    to challenge themselves to be better athletes and better people. CrossFit develops\n    the physical and mental toughness and confidence to take on any and all of life&rsquo;s\n    challenges.</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>&ldquo;World-Class Fitness in 100 Words:<br\n    /> Eat meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch and no sugar.\n    Keep intake to levels that will support exercise but not body fat.

What does this\n    mean? <strong>Functional Movements</strong> are those movements that you perform\n    every day. They are the natural, effective, and efficient movements that are used\n    to move your body as well as other objects. They allow us to move large loads\n    over long distances and to do so quickly. <strong>Intensity</strong> is synonymous\n    with power which is a measurement of how much, how many, how far, and how fast\n    we perform these functional movements. Intensity is relative to each individual\n    and the idea is to maximize each individual&rsquo;s level of intensity. <strong>Constantly\n    Varied</strong> means to take these functional movements and perform them in as\n    many different combinations and variations as possible.</p>\\r\\n<p>CrossFit, in\n    practice, is a Strength and Conditioning Program that is &ldquo;broad, general,\n    and inclusive&rdquo;, developing the functional fitness necessary to be ready\n    for the unknown. It aims to prepare you for whatever task life has in store for\n    you and in the same sense can be used by each individual to further their specific\n    goals. CrossFit combines Power Lifting, Olympic Weightlifting, Gymnastics, Kettlebell\n    Training, Running, Rowing, Jumping Rope, Mobility, and more to develop and maximize\n    these <strong>10 General Physical Skills</strong>:</p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li>Cardiovascular/Respiratory\n    Endurance</li>\\r\\n<li>Stamina</li>\\r\\n<li>Strength</li>\\r\\n<li>Flexibility</li>\\r\\n<li>Power</li>\\r\\n<li>Speed</li>\\r\\n<li>Coordination</li>\\r\\n<li>Agility</li>\\r\\n<li>Balance</li>\\r\\n<li>Accuracy</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p>CrossFit\n    is for people from all walks of life; from professional athletes to senior citizens\n    to people with disabilities. Every workout can be scaled to fit the fitness level\n    of the individual so that everyone is performing at the threshold of their own\n    personal limitations. CrossFit is more than a fitness program. CrossFit is an\n    international community of people that challenge themselves and encourage others\n    to challenge themselves to be better athletes and better people. CrossFit develops\n    the physical and mental toughness and confidence to take on any and all of life&rsquo;s\n    challenges.</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>&ldquo;World-Class Fitness in 100 Words:<br\n    /> Eat meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch and no sugar.\n    Keep intake to levels that will support exercise but not body fat.

What does this\n    mean? <strong>Functional Movements</strong> are those movements that you perform\n    every day. They are the natural, effective, and efficient movements that are used\n    to move your body as well as other objects. They allow us to move large loads\n    over long distances and to do so quickly. <strong>Intensity</strong> is synonymous\n    with power which is a measurement of how much, how many, how far, and how fast\n    we perform these functional movements. Intensity is relative to each individual\n    and the idea is to maximize each individual&rsquo;s level of intensity. <strong>Constantly\n    Varied</strong> means to take these functional movements and perform them in as\n    many different combinations and variations as possible.</p>\\r\\n<p>CrossFit, in\n    practice, is a Strength and Conditioning Program that is &ldquo;broad, general,\n    and inclusive&rdquo;, developing the functional fitness necessary to be ready\n    for the unknown. It aims to prepare you for whatever task life has in store for\n    you and in the same sense can be used by each individual to further their specific\n    goals. CrossFit combines Power Lifting, Olympic Weightlifting, Gymnastics, Kettlebell\n    Training, Running, Rowing, Jumping Rope, Mobility, and more to develop and maximize\n    these <strong>10 General Physical Skills</strong>:</p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li>Cardiovascular/Respiratory\n    Endurance</li>\\r\\n<li>Stamina</li>\\r\\n<li>Strength</li>\\r\\n<li>Flexibility</li>\\r\\n<li>Power</li>\\r\\n<li>Speed</li>\\r\\n<li>Coordination</li>\\r\\n<li>Agility</li>\\r\\n<li>Balance</li>\\r\\n<li>Accuracy</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p>CrossFit\n    is for people from all walks of life; from professional athletes to senior citizens\n    to people with disabilities. Every workout can be scaled to fit the fitness level\n    of the individual so that everyone is performing at the threshold of their own\n    personal limitations. CrossFit is more than a fitness program. CrossFit is an\n    international community of people that challenge themselves and encourage others\n    to challenge themselves to be better athletes and better people. CrossFit develops\n    the physical and mental toughness and confidence to take on any and all of life&rsquo;s\n    challenges.</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>&ldquo;World-Class Fitness in 100 Words:<br\n    /> Eat meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch and no sugar.\n    Keep intake to levels that will support exercise but not body fat.
